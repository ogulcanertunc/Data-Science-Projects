# Recommendation System with Movies and Ratings


With this project, I showed how a person can recommend movies on a user-based and item-based basis in this repo, where I process the recommendation systems. I also tried to show that there can be a hybrid recommendation system using these two methods.

You can get information about the recommendation systems from the medium link I provided and you can read the step-by-step explanations of the project I have made.
