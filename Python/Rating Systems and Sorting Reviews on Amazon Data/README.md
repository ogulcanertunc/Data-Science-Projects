# Rating Systems and Sorting Reviews on Amazon Data


As well as listing the products, it is necessary to sort the comments on the product pages in a certain order. In this project, I worked on an Amazon dataset to show what and how the comments are ordered. I compared the wilson lower bound method, which is useful for ranking methods, with a final ranking, such as score average rating and score positive negative differences.
