## Background

Hello there!

My name is Ogulcan Ertunc and welcome to my Project Portfolio! A little about me. My undergraduate education, I did on Industrial Engineering in Turkey, reading, and I gained experience in the field of statistics production and renewable energy sources in the last two years of my undergraduate education, management, and I focused on statistical modeling. Thanks to my interest in statistics, I wanted to do my master's degree in Italy in this field and I received my master's degree in Data Analytics for Business and Economics at Universit√† Cattolica Del Sacro Cuore.  

Now I focus on programming for the problems that arise, automate my life wherever possible and analyze topics that interest me, and I enjoy it a lot!
